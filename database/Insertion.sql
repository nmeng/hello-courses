The next few weeks introduce Newton\'s theory of motion and techniques for applying these concepts to predict the outcomes of simplified problems in mechanics, such as determining the motion of objects subject to constant forces. The next topic is Newton\'s theory of gravitation, including an introduction to planetary motion. This is followed by the formulation and application of the great conservation principles of classical physics: energy and momentum. Rotational dynamics, including torque and angular momentum is the next subject. The last topic of the term is the application of these principles to the special case of mechanical equilibrium, the stability conditions for structures, and the strength of materials.',4,Null,Null),
(NULL,'PHYS 252 Foundat Physics','The second term of the sequence focuses primarily on the physics of oscillations and waves, with specific applications to mechanics, sound, and optics. Other topics include fluids and strength of materials.',4,Null,Null),
(NULL,'PHYS 253 Foundat Physics I','This term is devoted to the subject of electricity and magnetism. We start with electrostatics: Coulomb\'s force, the electric field and methods for its calculation, Gauss\'s law, the electric potential, electric dipoles, capacitance, dielectrics, and electrical conductivity.',4,Null,Null),
(NULL,'BI 211 Gen Biol I: Cells','In this first course of the general biology sequence we study the biological processes from a cellular prospective. These concepts are central to understanding all other areas of biology. BI 211 is a prerequisite for all the other general biology courses in the sequence (Bi212-214).',4,Null,Null),
(NULL,'BI 212 Gen Biol II: Organisms','BI 212 is about the development and physiology of plants and animals. The course focuses on those aspects of physiology that seem to be universal across the enormous range of organisms that have evolved on our planet. We cover the topics of temperature regulation and the constraints imposed by temperature on organism level adaptations, mechanisms of short and long range transport in plants and animals and the constraints that geometry and the nature of diffusion impose on body plans, plant and animal nutrition (including the biology of appetite and the remarkable complexity of soil). We study the five senses and optical illusions by way of the nervous system, and the mechanisms by which plants seem to act as though they had a brain as they respond to various features of light. We cover the topic of development, by which single celled zygotes become complex and diverse organisms with a special emphasis on the genetics of development. Throughout we investigate the roles of natural selection on the physiological features of plants and animals. The course is part of a sequence, so the prerequisite is BI 211.',4,Null,Null),
(NULL,'BI 213 Gen Biol III: Populat','In this third term of the general biology sequence we build on concepts of how cells and organisms function to study processes and patterns that occur between different organisms and with organisms and their environments. We begin by examining mechanisms that cause genetic change in populations over time with a special focus on natural selection. We then examine the species concept and look at patterns of evolutionary change over long time periods. The last half of the term looks at ecological theory where we study different models of population growth and factors that regulate population growth in various organisms, including humans. We study ways in which two or more species interact and apply these ideas to current issues such as invasive species and loss of biodiversity. At the end of the term we study ecosystem processes such as energy flow and nutrient cycling between various ecosystem components. These are done using a case study such as tall grass prairie ecosystems, fire, and bison grazing.',4,Null,Null),
(NULL,'PSY 201 Mind and Brain','The primary goal of this course is to introduce students to basic concepts about core mental functions such as learning, memory and attention, and how the brain enables these functions. Across a variety of domains, this course examines the core principles that govern how our mind functions, as well as how these principles arise from the underlying neural substrate.',4,Null,Null),
(NULL,'PSY 202 Mind and Society','The course takes a research-based approach to psychology, considering at every step along the way how psychologists can best empirically test their theories and add new knowledge about human behavior. Students are given a chance to hone their own observation skills, to develop and test hypotheses, and to become critical consumers of research findings.',4,Null,Null),
(NULL,'PSY 304 Biopsychology','Relationships between brain and endocrine activity and behavior. Topics include sensation, perception, sexual behavior, drug effects, eating, drinking, sleeping, dreaming, and learning.',4,Null,Null),
(NULL,'PSY 330 Thinking','Psychological methods involved in problem solving, complex learning, and various forms of rational and irrational reasoning and belief systems.',4,Null,Null),

(NULL,'GEOG 322 Geomorphology','Geomorphology is the study of landforms on the surface of Earth and other planets, and the processes that form them. Geomorphology is a subfield of both physical geography and geology. Physical geography provides an integrated understanding of the systems that create our natural environment, including geomorphology, climatology, biogeography, and hydrology, and this course is part of the core physical geography sequence (Geog 321, 322, 323).',4,Null,Null),
(NULL,'GEOG 323 Biogeography','The Earth supports an incredible diversity of life. Biogeography is the study of the spatial patterns of this diversity both in the present and in the past. Biogeographers synthesize information from a very broad range of fields, including ecology, evolution, paleontology, and climatology. But biogeography is also a vigorous modern science concerned with developing and testing biogeographic theory. This course will provide the ecological and historical foundations for understanding the distribution and abundance of species, and the changes in distribution and abundance of species over time. Concepts presented in this class are highly relevant to conservation issues related to human impacts on ecosystems and increasingly rapid climate change.',4,Null,Null),
(NULL,'GEOL 201 Earth\'s Interior Heat','This introduction to physical geology emphasizes plate tectonics as the unifying concept for understanding the processes that cause earthquakes, volcanism and mountain building on the Earth. The Earth is a dynamic planet, and over its long history mountain belts have risen and been eroded away, continents have shifted their positions, new ocean basins have formed and sometimes closed up again, and volcanic activity has reshaped the continents and sea floor. The course begins with the evidence that supports the theory of plate tectonics and a discussion of how the interior and surface of the Earth interact with the oceans and atmosphere. Topics covered in the course include minerals, the formation of igneous and metamorphic rocks, volcanic activity, how rocks are deformed as mountains grow, why earthquakes occur, the composition and structure of the earth\'s interior, and the ways by which geologic time can be measured.',4,Null,Null),
(NULL,'GEOL 202 Surface & Envir Geol','Earth materials, the rock record, human interactions with surface environment.
