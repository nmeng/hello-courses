1,"CH 111 Intro Chem Principles","Chemical concepts for students in health care, biological applications, and environmental studies. Topics include atomic structure, solutions, acids, bases, stoichiometry, equilibrium, biomolecules, and organic functional groups. Lecture, demonstration.",4
2,"CH 113 Chem of Sustainability","Illustrates how chemistry provides innovative materials, processes, and consumer products that support sustainable solutions related to energy utilization, global warming and pollution prevention.",4
3,"CH 221 General Chemistry","Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes that it undergoes. It is a science that is central to our understanding of the natural world and it serves as a foundation for all other scientific disciplines. The General Chemistry sequence, beginning with CH 221, is designed for science majors and pre-professional students, and provides an introduction to the experimental and theoretical foundations of chemistry. Students will gain factual knowledge about the terminology and language of chemistry as well as an understanding of the underlying reasons why chemical processes occur. They will be expected to interpret, reason and problem solve using fundamental chemical principles.",4
4,"CH 222 General Chemistry","Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes that it undergoes. It is a science that is central to our understanding of the natural world and it serves as a foundation for all other scientific disciplines. The second course in the sequence, CH 222, is designed for science majors and pre-professional students, and provides an introduction to the experimental and theoretical foundations of chemistry. Students will gain factual knowledge about the terminology and language of chemistry as well as an understanding of the underlying reasons why chemical processes occur. They will be expected to interpret, reason and problem solve using fundamental chemical principles.",4
5,"CH 223 General Chemistry","Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes that it undergoes. It is a science that is central to our understanding of the natural world and it serves as a foundation for all other scientific disciplines. This final course in the sequence, CH 223, is designed for science majors and pre-professional students, and provides an introduction to the experimental and theoretical foundations of chemistry. Students will gain factual knowledge about the terminology and language of chemistry as well as an understanding of the underlying reasons why chemical processes occur. They will be expected to interpret, reason and problem solve using fundamental chemical principles.",4
