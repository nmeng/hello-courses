18,"CIS 170 Science of Computing","This course is an introduction to the field of computer science. It will be oriented to students who are considering a CIS major, but should be of interest to anyone who is curious about what computers are and how they are used in a wide variety of areas that impact our lives today. Some of the topics we will examine are: What is an algorithm? How do computer scientists evaluate the correctness and efficiency of algorithms? What sort of algorithms do scientists use to compare DNA and protein sequences? How are large databases organized? How do scientists access this information over the Internet? Although the topics are fairly technical, the lectures and projects in this course will be accessible to anyone with the basic background in math (the equivalent of Mth 112) Most lab projects will use a programming language named Ruby. Ruby is open source software that can be downloaded and installed on any system. Ruby is included with Mac OS/X 10.4. Instructions for installing it on Windows systems can be found on the class web page.",4

The primary objective of this course is to introduce the basic concepts and practices of computer science. The core ideas of computer programming will be explored using the Python programming language. We will cover fundamental approaches to problem solving and the creation of software solutions as well as introduce the notions of data abstraction and object-oriented programming.",4
29,"CIS 211 Computer Science II","This course continues instruction in object-oriented design and programming. Class hierarchies, inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces are used to represent the structure of a problem domain and allow reuse and specialization of methods and instance variables by subclasses. Several important 'patterns,' i.e., ways of using the language, are introduced to facilitate problem solving in an object-oriented context. A significant programming project is developed over a series of lab assignments.",4
